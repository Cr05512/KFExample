# KFExample
Kalman Filter Matlab implementation example
This program implements the standard Kalman filter over two models:
- Constant Velocity (CV)
- Constant Acceleration (CA)

It provides a series of parameters to play with, which account for the perturbations in both the state and measurements of the system.
The real and estimated trajectory are shown at the end, together with the real (cleared of noise) and corrupted measurements.
